##  **Packet Tracer Lab (CCNA Switching)**


- Configured a network consisting of 2 core switches, 3 access switches, and various endpoint devices.  
- Configured VLANs 1, 10, and 20 across the network, and configured switched virtual interfaces on the core switches (SVIs).  
- Enabled Inter-VLAN routing to enable network connectivty across VLANs on the network.  
- Subnetted seperate subnets for each VLAN.  

Packet tracer file attached. (Spanning-tree protocol may take up to one minute to converge before the lab will work).
